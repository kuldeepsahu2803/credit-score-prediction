# Credit Score Prediction Model

A machine learning project that predicts credit scores using a Random Forest Classifier. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.

## Project Overview
The model uses customer financial data to classify credit scores into categories, supporting risk management in financial institutions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding)
- Random Forest Classifier for prediction
- Visualizations for feature analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/credit-score-prediction.git
   cd credit-score-prediction
